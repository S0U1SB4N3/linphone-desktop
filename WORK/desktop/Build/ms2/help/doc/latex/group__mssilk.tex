S\+I\+LK Speech Codec (draft-\/vos-\/silk-\/02) plugins filters to encode and decode audio.  


S\+I\+LK Speech Codec (draft-\/vos-\/silk-\/02) plugins filters to encode and decode audio. 

{\bfseries M\+S\+S\+I\+L\+K\+Enc} and {\bfseries M\+S\+S\+I\+L\+K\+Dec} are 2 Mediastremer2\textquotesingle{}s filters available to encode/decode speech using S\+I\+LK sdk from Skype. This integration leverage on source code from\+: {\tt http\+://developer.\+skype.\+com/silk}. Note that usage of this plugin is subject to license from Skype. ~\newline

 {\bfseries  Supported S\+I\+LK features} ~\newline
 S\+I\+LK is a multi rate, multi sampling frequency codec with variable packetization time. S\+I\+LK allows control of these parameters using standard Mediastreamer2 functions. ~\newline
~\newline
 {\bfseries  init} ~\newline
 mssilk is automatically loaded by Medistreamer2 in case libmssilk.\+so is present in the Mediastremer2 plugin directory. Alternatively it is possible to load it by calling the function 
\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{keywordtype}{void} libmssilk\_init() 
\end{DoxyCode}
 Very usefull for Android or I\+OS. ~\newline

 {\bfseries  M\+S\+S\+I\+L\+K\+Enc} ~\newline
 M\+S\+S\+I\+L\+K\+Enc is a filter from category \#\+M\+S\+\_\+\+F\+I\+L\+T\+E\+R\+\_\+\+E\+N\+C\+O\+D\+ER. It has its {\bfseries enc\+\_\+fmt} value set to {\bfseries \char`\"{}\+S\+I\+L\+K\char`\"{}}.The following key control functions are implemented\+: ~\newline
 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries \#\+M\+S\+\_\+\+F\+I\+L\+T\+E\+R\+\_\+\+S\+E\+T\+\_\+\+S\+A\+M\+P\+L\+E\+\_\+\+R\+A\+TE} Set both the output and input sampling rate. This value is internally mapped to both maximum codec sampling rate and A\+PI sampling rate. Supported value are 8000, 12000, 16000 and 24000. This value can be changed at any time. 
\item {\bfseries \#\+M\+S\+\_\+\+F\+I\+L\+T\+E\+R\+\_\+\+S\+E\+T\+\_\+\+B\+I\+T\+R\+A\+TE} Set the target network output bitrate for this filter. As this value takes into account R\+T\+P/\+U\+D\+P/\+IP overhead, this filter first computes a codec bitrate from both this input and current packetization time value (I.\+E ptime). Computed codec bitrate value is passed to the S\+I\+LK encoder as target bitrate. This value can be changed at any time. 
\item {\bfseries \#\+M\+S\+\_\+\+F\+I\+L\+T\+E\+R\+\_\+\+A\+D\+D\+\_\+\+F\+M\+TP} Set codec specific parameter as described in draft-\/vos-\/silk-\/02. Default values are those proposed by draft-\/vos-\/silk-\/02. Supported parameters are {\bfseries maxptime}, {\bfseries ptime}, {\bfseries useinbandfec}.

 Preset S\+I\+LK encoder\textquotesingle{}s values not configurable are\+: encoder {\bfseries complexity} set to 1, {\bfseries packet\+Loss\+Percentage} set to 10 and {\bfseries use\+D\+TX} set to 0. ~\newline
~\newline
 {\bfseries  M\+S\+S\+I\+L\+Dec} ~\newline
 M\+S\+S\+I\+L\+Dec is a filter from category \#\+M\+S\+\_\+\+F\+I\+L\+T\+E\+R\+\_\+\+D\+E\+C\+O\+D\+ER. It has its {\bfseries enc\+\_\+fmt} value set to {\bfseries \char`\"{}\+S\+I\+L\+K\char`\"{}}.This filter make use of S\+I\+LK\textquotesingle{}s builtin Packet Lose Concealment and Forward Error Correction feature.\+The following key control functions are implemented\+: ~\newline
 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries \#\+M\+S\+\_\+\+F\+I\+L\+T\+E\+R\+\_\+\+S\+E\+T\+\_\+\+S\+A\+M\+P\+L\+E\+\_\+\+R\+A\+TE} Set output sampling rate. This value is internally mapped to A\+PI sampling rate.\+Supported value are 8000, 12000, 16000, 24000, 32000, 44000 and 48000. This value can be changed at any time.
