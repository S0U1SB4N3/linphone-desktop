\fBFilter:\fP A filter is a mediastreamer2 component that process data\&. A filter have 0 or several INPUT pins and 0 or several OUTPUT pins\&. Here is a list of possible use of filters:
.IP "  \(bu" 4
capture audio or video data\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
play audio or display video data\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
send or receive RTP data\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
encode or decode audio or video data\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
transform (resize video, resample audio\&.\&.\&.) data\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
duplicate any kind of data\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
mix audio/video data\&.

\fBGraph:\fP A graph is a manager of filters connected together\&. It will transfer data from OUTPUT pins to INPUT pins and will be responsible for running filters\&.

.SH "How do I use mediastreamer2?"
.PP
Mediastreamer2 can be used for a lot of different purpose\&. The primary use is to manage RTP audio and video session\&. You will need to use the API to build filters, link them together in a graph\&. Then the ticker API will help you to start and stop the graph\&.
.PP
Basic graph example:
.PP
.PP
The above graph is composed of three filters\&. The first one has no input: it captures audio data directly from the drivers and provide it to the OUTPUT pin\&. This data is sent to the INPUT pin of the encoder which of course encodes the data and sends it to its OUTPUT pin\&. This pin is connected to the INPUT pin of a filter capable of building and sending RTP packets\&.
.PP
The modular design helps you to encode in many different formats just by replacing the 'ENCODE FILTER' with another one\&. mediastreamer2 contains internal support for g711u, g711a, speex and gsm\&. Other encoding formats can be added by implementing new filters as plugins which can then be dynamically loaded\&.
