.SH SYNOPSIS
.br
.PP
.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
SILK Speech Codec (draft-vos-silk-02) plugins filters to encode and decode audio\&. 

\fBMSSILKEnc\fP and \fBMSSILKDec\fP are 2 Mediastremer2's filters available to encode/decode speech using SILK sdk from Skype\&. This integration leverage on source code from: http://developer.skype.com/silk\&. Note that usage of this plugin is subject to license from Skype\&. 
.br

.br
 \fB Supported SILK features\fP 
.br
 SILK is a multi rate, multi sampling frequency codec with variable packetization time\&. SILK allows control of these parameters using standard Mediastreamer2 functions\&. 
.br

.br
 \fB init\fP 
.br
 mssilk is automatically loaded by Medistreamer2 in case libmssilk\&.so is present in the Mediastremer2 plugin directory\&. Alternatively it is possible to load it by calling the function 
.PP
.nf
void libmssilk_init()

 Very usefull for Android or IOS\&.

.br
 \fB MSSILKEnc\fP 
.br
 MSSILKEnc is a filter from category #MS_FILTER_ENCODER\&. It has its \fBenc_fmt\fP value set to \fB'SILK'\fP\&.The following key control functions are implemented: 
.br
 
.PD 0

.IP "\(bu" 2
\fB#MS_FILTER_SET_SAMPLE_RATE\fP Set both the output and input sampling rate\&. This value is internally mapped to both maximum codec sampling rate and API sampling rate\&. Supported value are 8000, 12000, 16000 and 24000\&. This value can be changed at any time\&. 
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fB#MS_FILTER_SET_BITRATE\fP Set the target network output bitrate for this filter\&. As this value takes into account RTP/UDP/IP overhead, this filter first computes a codec bitrate from both this input and current packetization time value (I\&.E ptime)\&. Computed codec bitrate value is passed to the SILK encoder as target bitrate\&. This value can be changed at any time\&. 
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fB#MS_FILTER_ADD_FMTP\fP Set codec specific parameter as described in draft-vos-silk-02\&. Default values are those proposed by draft-vos-silk-02\&. Supported parameters are \fBmaxptime\fP, \fBptime\fP, \fBuseinbandfec\fP\&. 
.PP

.br
 Preset SILK encoder's values not configurable are: encoder \fBcomplexity\fP set to 1, \fBpacketLossPercentage\fP set to 10 and \fBuseDTX\fP set to 0\&. 
.br

.br
 \fB MSSILDec\fP 
.br
 MSSILDec is a filter from category #MS_FILTER_DECODER\&. It has its \fBenc_fmt\fP value set to \fB'SILK'\fP\&.This filter make use of SILK's builtin Packet Lose Concealment and Forward Error Correction feature\&.The following key control functions are implemented: 
.br
 
.PD 0

.IP "\(bu" 2
\fB#MS_FILTER_SET_SAMPLE_RATE\fP Set output sampling rate\&. This value is internally mapped to API sampling rate\&.Supported value are 8000, 12000, 16000, 24000, 32000, 44000 and 48000\&. This value can be changed at any time\&.
