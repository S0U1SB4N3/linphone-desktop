.PP 
Making an audio conference\&. 

This API allows to create a conference entirely managed by the client\&. No server capabilities are required\&. The way such conference is created is by doing the following:
.br
 The application shall makes 'normal' calls to several destinations (using \fBlinphone_core_invite()\fP ), one after another\&. While initiating the second call, the first one is automatically paused\&. Then, once the second call is established, the application has the possibility to merge the two calls to form a conference where each participant (the local participant, the remote destination of the first call, the remote destination of the second call) can talk together\&. This must be done by adding the two calls to the conference using \fBlinphone_core_add_to_conference()\fP
.PP
Once merged into a conference the LinphoneCall objects representing the calls that were established remain unchanged, except that they are tagged as part of the conference (see \fBlinphone_call_is_in_conference()\fP )\&. The calls in a conference are in the LinphoneCallStreamsRunning state\&.
.PP
Only a single conference can be created: the purpose of this feature is to allow the local user to create, take part and manage the conference\&. This API is not designed to create a conference server application\&.
.PP
Up to 10 calls can be merged into the conference, however depending on the CPU usage required for doing the encoding/decoding of the streams of each participants, the effective limit can be lower\&.
