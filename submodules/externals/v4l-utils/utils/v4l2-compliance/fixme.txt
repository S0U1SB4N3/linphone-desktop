This file keeps track of ambiguities and just plain problems found in the
V4L2 specification while writing and testing this compliance test tool.

At some point in time these issues should be resolved, but by placing them
here they won't be forgotten.

- Control documentation is out of date regarding how
  error_idx should be set for G/S_EXT_CTRLS and for TRY_EXT_CTRLS (which does
  this slightly differently).

- RGB pixel formats: endianness issues: two tables in the spec.

- Duplicate controls: V4L2_CID_EXPOSURE (user class) and V4L2_CID_EXPOSURE_ABSOLUTE
  (camera class).
